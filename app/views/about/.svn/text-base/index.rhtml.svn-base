<h2>About JobCorps</h2>
<h5>JobCorps</h5>
<p>JobCorps was first created in 2001 as a job posting board for the AU and DC community.  Despite its simplicity, it served well and resulted in the employment of thousands of American University students.</p>
<p>Employers have turned to JobCorps repeatedly for reliable, hard-working students.  Commissioned by the 2005-2006 administration, JobCorps continues this tradition of excellence with a more advanced set of features: account management, advanced search, internal messaging, and more.</p>
<p>JobCorps was developed by student at American University and released in July of 2006.</p>
